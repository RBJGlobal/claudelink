# ClaudeLink

**The hub where your AI agents connect.**

ClaudeLink lets multiple Claude Code instances running in separate terminals communicate with each other in real time. Open four terminals, give each agent a role, and watch them collaborate — sending messages, sharing findings, and coordinating work through a shared bulletin board.

```
Terminal 1 (reviewer)  ──┐
Terminal 2 (developer) ──┤── ClaudeLink ── SQLite
Terminal 3 (tester)    ──┤
Terminal 4 (ops)       ──┘
```

A local **Command Center** at `http://127.0.0.1:7878` opens automatically with the first agent — see who's online, watch messages flow, and kill stuck servers without touching the terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and configure (one command)
npx claudelink init
```

Restart your Claude Code terminals. That's it.

### In Terminal 1:
> "Register as a code reviewer working on the auth module"

### In Terminal 2:
> "Register as a developer. Check inbox for messages from the reviewer."

### Terminal 1 says to Claude:
> "Send a message to the developer: Found a SQL injection vulnerability in auth.ts line 42. The user input is not sanitized before the query."

### Terminal 2 says to Claude:
> "Read my inbox"

The developer agent receives the reviewer's message and can act on it.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the package
```bash
npm install -g claudelink
```

### Step 2: Add to Claude Code (pick one)

**Global (recommended — works in every project):**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user claudelink -- claudelink-server
```
This adds ClaudeLink to `~/.claude.json` so it's available in every Claude Code session, in every project. One command, done forever.

**Per-Project (only this project):**
```bash
cd your-project
npx claudelink init
```
This adds ClaudeLink to `.mcp.json` in your project directory only.

### Step 3: Restart Claude Code

Close and reopen Claude Code in your terminals. ClaudeLink tools will be available automatically.

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code CLI

## How It Works

ClaudeLink is an [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Each Claude Code instance connects to it automatically and gets access to communication tools. All instances share a single SQLite database (`~/.claudelink/nexus.db`) using WAL mode for safe concurrent access.

There is no daemon or background service. Each Claude Code session spawns its own MCP server process, and they coordinate through the shared database.

## Command Center

The Command Center is a local web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:7878` that gives you a live view of every agent in the mesh. The first `claudelink-server` to boot in any terminal launches it automatically — subsequent agents share the same window. It survives MCP restarts and only exits when you click **Quit UI** (or run `claudelink ui --stop`).

### What it shows

- **Running servers** — every `claudelink-server` process, with PID, TTY, uptime, and the role it registered as. Per-row **Kill** button sends SIGTERM.
- **Registered agents** — role, description, online status, message counts (sent / received), and last-seen timestamp. Per-row **Kill agent** SIGTERMs the matching server.
- **Health** — total agents, unread/total messages, bulletin entries, orphan blockers, FK violations, and servers running. The **Heal orphans** button cascade-cleans every dead agent's messages and bulletin rows in one transaction.
- **Recent messages** — the last several messages across all agents, with unread and priority badges.

The page auto-refreshes every 2 seconds. **Kill all servers** in the header drops the whole mesh in one click.

### Lifecycle

A lock file at `~/.claudelink/ui.lock` prevents duplicate windows. The launcher detached-spawns the UI process with `unref()` so it outlives the MCP parent. If a stale lock is detected (PID dead and no heartbeat at `/api/heartbeat`), a fresh UI takes over.

To opt out, set `CLAUDELINK_UI=off` in the environment before starting Claude Code.

```bash
claudelink ui          # start it manually (or just spawn any agent)
claudelink ui --stop   # graceful shutdown
```

## Available Tools

Once connected, Claude Code gains these tools:

### `register`
Register this agent with a role so others can find it.
```
"Register as a developer working on the payment system"
```

### `send`
Send a direct message to an agent by role.
```
"Send a high-priority message to the reviewer: the fix is ready for re-review"
```

### `broadcast`
Send a message to ALL connected agents.
```
"Broadcast: deployment starting in 5 minutes, hold all merges"
```

### `read_inbox`
Check for new messages.
```
"Check my inbox"
```

### `get_agents`
See who's online.
```
"Show me all connected agents"
```

### `post_bulletin`
Post to the shared bulletin board (persistent announcements).
```
"Post to bulletin: v2.1 release branch created, all features frozen"
```

### `get_bulletin`
Read the bulletin board.
```
"Show the bulletin board"
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
claudelink init            # Configure for current project
claudelink init --global   # Configure globally
claudelink status          # Show registered agents and message stats
claudelink ui              # Open the Command Center in your browser
claudelink ui --stop       # Stop the Command Center
claudelink reset           # Clear all data (fresh start)
claudelink help            # Show help
```

## Autonomous Mode (Recommended)

By default, you'd have to tell Claude "check my inbox" manually every time. That defeats the purpose. With autonomous mode, agents communicate **on their own** — checking for messages and sending updates without you asking.

### Automatic Setup

**This is installed automatically** when you run `claudelink init` or `claudelink init --global`. The init command creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with the autonomous communication instructions in the appropriate directory:

- `init --global` → writes to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (all projects)
- `init` → writes to `./CLAUDE.md` (current project only)

If you already have a `CLAUDE.md`, the ClaudeLink instructions are appended without overwriting your existing content. Running init multiple times is safe — it won't duplicate the instructions.

### What It Teaches Claude

The `CLAUDE.md` file instructs every Claude Code session to:

- **Check inbox automatically** before and after every task
- **Send updates proactively** to other agents when work is completed
- **Respond to messages immediately** without waiting for you to say "check inbox"
- **Post to the bulletin board** when making decisions that affect the project

### Manual Fallback

If the automatic setup doesn't work on your system (different directory structure, permissions, etc.), you can manually create or add to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## ClaudeLink - Autonomous Agent Communication

You are part of a multi-agent team. Other agents may be running in separate
terminals and can send you messages at any time via ClaudeLink.

### Automatic Inbox Checking

- BEFORE starting any task: Check your inbox using read_inbox first
- AFTER completing any task: Check your inbox again using read_inbox
- If you receive a message, acknowledge it and act on it before moving on
- If a message requires you to change your current work, do so immediately
- If a message is from another agent asking for information, respond using send
  before continuing your own work
- High-priority messages take precedence over your current task

### Autonomous Collaboration

- When you finish work that another agent might care about, proactively send
  them an update
- If you encounter a problem that another agent's role could help with, send
  them a message
- When you make a decision that affects the project, post it to the bulletin board
- If you're blocked waiting for another agent, say so and check inbox again

### Communication Shortcuts

- "check response" or "check messages" — Use read_inbox to check for new messages
- "ask the [role]" — Send a message to that role and check inbox for their reply
- "tell the [role]" — Send a one-way message to that role
- "who's online" — Use get_agents to list all connected agents
- "update the board" — Use post_bulletin to post a status update
- "check the board" — Use get_bulletin to read the bulletin board
```

### Per-Project vs Global

| File | Applies to |
|------|-----------|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | **Every project, every terminal** — recommended |
| `your-project/CLAUDE.md` | Only that specific project |

If you want autonomous mode everywhere (most people do), use the global file. If you only want it for specific projects, put it in the project's `CLAUDE.md`.

### What Autonomous Mode Looks Like

Without autonomous mode:
```
You: Fix the bug in auth.ts
Claude: (fixes the bug)
You: Now check your inbox
Claude: You have 1 message from the reviewer...
You: Send the reviewer an update
Claude: Message sent.
```

With autonomous mode:
```
You: Fix the bug in auth.ts
Claude: (checks inbox — sees a tip from the reviewer about the bug)
       (fixes the bug using the reviewer's guidance)
       (sends the reviewer: "Fixed it, here's what I changed...")
       (posts to bulletin: "auth.ts bug fixed")
       (checks inbox again — no new messages)
       Done. I fixed the token validation bug. The reviewer had already
       flagged the exact line, so I used their suggestion.
```

One instruction from you. All the communication happens automatically.

```

Each Claude Code session spawns its own MCP server process via stdio. All processes read and write to the same SQLite database. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode ensures concurrent access is safe and performant.

### Why SQLite?
- Zero configuration — single file, no server to run
- WAL mode handles concurrent readers and writers
- Survives process crashes — no data loss
- Portable across macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Message Flow
1. Agent A calls `send(to="developer", message="...")`
2. MCP Server A writes a row to the `messages` table
3. Agent B calls `read_inbox()`
4. MCP Server B reads unread rows from `messages` and marks them read
5. Agent B receives the message and can act on it

### Agent Lifecycle
- Agents register with a `role` and their process `pid`
- A heartbeat updates `last_seen` every 30 seconds
- When listing agents, dead processes (checked via `kill -0 pid`) are automatically pruned
- No manual cleanup needed

## Configuration

ClaudeLink stores its database at `~/.claudelink/nexus.db`. This path is fixed so all Claude Code instances across all projects converge on the same communication hub.

### .mcp.json (per-project)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudelink": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "claudelink-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### ~/.claude.json (global via CLI)
```bash
claude mcp add --scope user claudelink -- claudelink-server
```

## FAQ

### Wait, does `npx claudelink init` start Claude?

**No.** You only run `npx claudelink init` **once**. It's a setup command that writes a config file (`.mcp.json`) telling Claude Code to connect to ClaudeLink on startup. After that, you never need to run it again.

Your daily workflow is exactly the same as before:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — start Claude normally
claude

# Terminal 2 — start Claude normally
claude

# Terminal 3 — start Claude with full auto-permissions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Claude Code reads `.mcp.json` when it starts, sees ClaudeLink is configured, and automatically connects. The `register`, `send`, `read_inbox`, and other tools just appear — no extra commands.

Then you just talk naturally:

**Terminal 1:**
> "Register as a code reviewer working on the auth module"

**Terminal 2:**
> "Register as a developer. Send a message to the reviewer asking if auth.ts looks good."

### How do I start Claude with different permission modes?

ClaudeLink works with all Claude Code startup modes:

```bash
# Standard mode (Claude asks before using tools)
claude

# Skip all permission prompts
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Auto-approve only ClaudeLink tools (recommended)
claude --allowedTools "mcp__claudelink__*"
```

### How do I disable ClaudeLink?

You do **not** need to restart your computer. There are several options depending on what you want:

**Option 1: Disable for a specific project**

Remove the `claudelink` entry from your project's `.mcp.json`:

```bash
# Open the config
nano .mcp.json
```

Delete the `"claudelink": { ... }` block, save, and restart Claude Code in that terminal. ClaudeLink tools will no longer appear for that project.

**Option 2: Disable globally**

If you installed globally, remove it via CLI:

```bash
claude mcp remove --scope user claudelink
```

**Option 3: Clear all data but keep it installed**

```bash
npx claudelink reset
```

This deletes the database (all messages, agents, bulletin entries) but keeps the config so you can start fresh.

**Option 4: Full uninstall (remove everything)**

```bash
# 1. Remove from project config
#    Edit .mcp.json and delete the claudelink entry

# 2. Remove from global config
claude mcp remove --scope user claudelink

# 3. Uninstall the package
npm uninstall -g claudelink

# 4. Delete all ClaudeLink data
rm -rf ~/.claudelink
```

After any of these, just restart your Claude Code sessions. No computer restart needed — just close and reopen the terminal, or start a new `claude` session.

### Can I temporarily disable it without deleting anything?

Yes. In your `.mcp.json`, add `"disabled": true`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claudelink": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "claudelink-server",
      "disabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Set it back to `false` (or remove the line) to re-enable. Restart Claude Code after changing.

### Ideas for Contributions
- **Agent groups/channels**: Named channels for topic-based communication
- **Message history**: Tool to view past messages (not just unread)
- **File sharing**: Agents can share file paths or code snippets with structured formatting
- **Priority notifications**: Interrupt the current agent when a high-priority message arrives
- **Agent templates**: Pre-built role configurations for common workflows
- **Webhooks**: Notify external services when agents communicate
- **Encryption**: Encrypt messages at rest in the database
- **Multi-machine support**: Replace SQLite with a networked backend for remote agent communication
